In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Rachel McCollin will teach you how to do just that! 

You'll learn how to customize the WordPress admin screens to create a bespoke version of the WordPress admin for yourself and your clients. This will make it easier for your clients and users to create and edit sidebars and other content thatâ€™s repeated across your site.
